I wasn't able to do exercies 1 as the video wasn't up so I jumped to exercise2.

Exercise 2:

Thank goodness for stop and replay. The video is great and short so it won't take a lot of time to do. Also the finished product wasn't perfect which left the student wanting (in theory) to go out and learn more to get the clock to work properly.

I changed the background image and the color of the hands on the clock.
I also changed the format of the file structure.
Also changed the function to add an if/else scenerio to help control the massive jolt and time offset that occured at the 60 second mark. It still jolts slightly but it corrects its self and continues to show the correct time.

I'll continue to work on this to fully correct the jolt because it's bugging me.
